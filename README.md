## Installing

### Linux / OS X

To install for linux or OS X systems, please run `curl https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mdlr-dist/v1/install.sh | bash`

### Dockerfile-compatible Automated Installer (assumes *nix system, root, non-interactive)

For docker-ized installs or systems where you are in the root shell, please run `curl https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mdlr-dist/v1/install-root.sh | bash`

## Windows (Beta support)

Download the `.exe` binary for your platform:

- [Windows x64](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mdlr-dist/v1/windows-amd64-mdlr.exe)

- [Windows x86](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mdlr-dist/v1/windows-386-mdlr.exe)

From there, you can put the `.exe` file where you like and run it from the command line/powershell.

If you have any issues, with the Windows install/functionality, please report them [here]().

## Updating

Please run the install script for your platform above to get the latest updates. For windows users, replace the `.exe` binary

## Using Mdlr

### Example workflow

1.  `cd project/directory/ # Enter the project directory`
2.  `mdlr init`
3.  `mdlr add --name depname --path deps/mydep --url https://github/org/mydep.git`
4.  `mdlr import -f # Reset the module forcefully (wipe changes, if any) and then import it at the version in the mdlr.yml file. This is the recommended command`
5.  `mdlr list # List the modules`
6.  `mdlr status # Get the status overview`
7.  `mdlr update -f # Reset the module forcefully (wipe changes, if any) and then update it and write the new update to the mdlr.yml file`
8.  `vim mdlr.yml # View/edit the mdlr.yml file`

### Create a new mdlr project

In the project directory, run `mdlr init`

### Import modules for a mdlr project

In the project directory, run `mdlr import -f`


### Update modules for a mdlr project

In the project directory, run `mdlr update -f` (that's like doing git pull in each module)

### Edit a module and commit it

Go into the submodule directory, make modifications, and commit them.
Then go back to the project root repository, `git status`, then `git add .` and commit that change. It will commit the latest commit from the submodule.

If there are modified files in the submodule that are not committed, then it's impossible to commit it in the project root repository.


### Commands overview

- `help`: get a help overview
- `init`: generate a mdlr.yml file in the directory
- `list`: list the current modules
- `add`: add a module to the mdlr.yml file
- `remove`: remove a module
- `import`: import a module
- `update`: update a module
- `status`: get the status for the mdlr.yml or invidual modules

## Installing from Source / Developing

### Prerequisites

1. Ubuntu 16.04 (Server or Desktop) operating system -- other similar systems and OS X might work, but aren't guaranteed to...
2. GoLang 1.9.^ installed
3. GoLang dependency manager installed [(Install guide)](https://github.com/golang/dep#setup)

### Get the project

1. `go get github.com/exlinc/mdlr`

### Setting up `dep`

1. `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/exlinc/mdlr`
2. `dep ensure -v # Set to verbose to track the progress as this might take a while...`

### Build the code (for dev platform)

1. `go build # Optionally, use go run main.go instead of the build+run flow and your code will compile every time you run with the latest changes`

### Run the code

1. `./mdlr # Runs the latest output of go build` OR `go run main.go # Compiles a temp binary from the latest changes and runs it all in one command`

### Install the dev binary on your system

1. Run `go install` which (if your `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH`) will create a globally-accessible `tools-mdlr` binary that you can use to easily test a 'dev' version of your code anywhere on your dev system with `tools-mdlr`

## Distribution

### Build the distribution binaries

1. `./xplatform-build.sh`
2. See the output binaries in the `./build` directory!

### Uploading to S3 for distribution

The S3 upload is done by the maintainer (EXL Inc.) for new releases to the bucket used in the install scripts.
